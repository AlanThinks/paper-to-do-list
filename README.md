# Paper To-Do-List App

### A React App by @AlanThinks

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the [Live Sample Here](http://alanthinks.github.io/projects/paper-to-do-list-app/index.html)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Enjoyed making this mini app, it was challenging getting it to be responsive partly because I did not follow a "mobile-first" approach when creating it.

But the Programming Functionality was fun to develop, as a Junior Developer it was tough sometime's getting the counters to include/not include the tasks that were being "completed" or "deleted".

**Side Note: I highly recommend you ~Eat The Cookies~ ðŸ˜‰**
