# Paper To-Do-List App

### A React App by @AlanThinks

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the [Live Sample Here](http://alanthinks.com/projects/paper-to-do-list-app/index.html)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Really enjoyed making this mini app. I did this originally as a junior React developer and it was tough sometime's getting the counters to include/not include the tasks that were being "completed" or "deleted", it was also challenging getting it to be responsive partly because I did not follow a "mobile-first" approach when creating it because of the way the app is visually designed.

Overall though I really enjoyed joining form and function!
